# What is USDC on Base?

New to crypto? No problem. Here's everything you need to know in 2 minutes.

## TL;DR

- **USDC** = Digital dollar (1 USDC = $1 USD, always)
- **Base** = Coinbase's blockchain network (fast, cheap transactions)
- **Why?** = Pay AI models per-request without API keys or subscriptions

## What is USDC?

USDC is a **stablecoin** - a cryptocurrency that's always worth $1 USD.

| Regular Crypto | USDC |
|----------------|------|
| Bitcoin goes up and down | 1 USDC = $1, always |
| Volatile, risky | Stable, predictable |
| Speculative | Just digital dollars |

USDC is issued by Circle (backed by Coinbase). It's the most trusted stablecoin.

## What is Base?

Base is a **blockchain network** built by Coinbase.

Think of it like:
- Visa/Mastercard = payment network for credit cards
- Base = payment network for crypto

**Why Base?**
- Built by Coinbase (trusted)
- Very low fees (~$0.001 per transaction)
- Fast (transactions in seconds)
- Easy to get USDC from Coinbase directly

## How to Get USDC on Base

### Option 1: Coinbase (Easiest)

1. Download [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) app
2. Buy USDC (use debit card, bank transfer, or Apple Pay)
3. Send to your BlockRun wallet address
   - When sending, select **Base** network (not Ethereum!)

**Important:** Make sure you select "Base" as the network when sending. If you send on Ethereum network, it won't work.

### Option 2: Already Have Crypto?

If you have USDC on Ethereum or other chains:
1. Go to [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Bridge USDC from Ethereum → Base

### Option 3: Other Exchanges

Many exchanges support Base network withdrawals:
- Binance

## How Much Do I Need?

| Amount | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| $1 | ~1,000 GPT-5 calls |
| $5 | ~5,000 GPT-5 calls + images |
| $10 | Heavy usage for weeks |

**Start with $1-5.** You can always add more later.

## Is It Safe?

**Your money:**
- USDC is backed 1:1 by real dollars in bank accounts
- Audited monthly by top accounting firms
- Used by millions of people

**Your wallet:**
- Private key stored locally on your machine (`~/.blockrun/`)
- Key never sent anywhere - only transaction signatures
- You control it, not us

**Recommended:** Keep small amounts ($5-20) in your BlockRun wallet. Think of it like a prepaid card.

## FAQ

### What if I send to wrong network?
If you accidentally send USDC on Ethereum instead of Base, it goes to a different address. Contact care@blockrun.ai and we'll try to help recover it.

### Can I withdraw my USDC?
Yes! Your wallet is a standard Ethereum wallet. You can import the private key into any wallet app (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) and send your USDC anywhere.

### Why not just use credit card?
Credit cards have:
- 3% fees
- Chargebacks (so providers require subscriptions)
- Geographic restrictions

Crypto enables true pay-per-request with near-zero fees.

### Why not API keys?
API keys require:
- Account with each provider (OpenAI, xAI, Google...)
- Credit card on file with each
- Managing multiple billing accounts

BlockRun: One wallet → all models.
