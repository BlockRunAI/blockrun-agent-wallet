# BlockRun Agent Skill - GTM Plan

## Core Positioning

**"Give Claude superpowers - access any LLM with one wallet, no API keys"**

## Key Differentiators

| Us | Competitors |
|----|-------------|
| Stablecoin micropayments (USDC) | API keys for each provider |
| One wallet = all models | Manage 5+ API keys & billing accounts |
| $1 = 1,000 GPT-4 calls | Pay each provider separately |
| Zero config, just send USDC | Register, bind card, get key, configure env... |
| "Second opinion" use case | Just routing/switching |
| Skill (simple) | MCP (complex) |

## Competitors

| Project | Approach | Payment |
|---------|----------|---------|
| [claude_code-multi-AI-MCP](https://github.com/RaiAnsar/claude_code-multi-AI-MCP) | MCP | User's API keys |
| [claude-code-router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router) | Router | User's API keys |
| [deepseek-code](https://github.com/yksanjo/deepseek-code) | Standalone CLI | DeepSeek account |

**We are the first crypto-native Claude Code skill.**

## Target Audience

1. Claude Code power users who want multi-model access
2. Developers tired of managing API keys
3. Crypto-native developers
4. AI researchers who need model comparison

## Killer Use Cases

1. **Second Opinion** - "use gpt to review claude's code"
2. **Real-time Data** - "ask grok what's trending on X"
3. **Cost Optimization** - "use deepseek for this (10x cheaper)"
4. **Model Comparison** - "compare how gpt and claude answer this"
